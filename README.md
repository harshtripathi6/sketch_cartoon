# sketch_cartoon
Get your pencil sketch and cartoon from an input image
Just change the repository to your input image in the cartoon_ready_image and that will not be required if you want to execute the cartoon_take_image. 
  1. Cartoon_ready_image takes an input of a pre existing image and gets the output 
  2. Cartoon_take_image takes the live image from your webcam and saves it into the folder and uses that as an input.
